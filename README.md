# Get Started 

Step 1: `npm install` is the first command to execute and get some dependencies.

Step 2: used two APIs: one for Country-province information and pokemon api for fetching infomation of pokemon

Step 3: I did not use .env as it would be ignored and both the API is free and open-source.

Step 4: kindly refresh Page if any issue with API face as it's free API. So, it may create some issue for fetching

Step 5: All the data is saved on localStorage of Browser. If want to wipe and start from scratch than delete these
    key from localStorage.
